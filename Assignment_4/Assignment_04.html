      Karachi (/kəˈrɑːtʃi/; Urdu: کراچی; Sindhi: ڪراچي; IPA: [kəˈraːtʃi]
      (listen)) is the most populous city in Pakistan and 12th most populous
      city in the world, with a population of over 20 million.[17][18][19] It is
      situated at the southern tip of the country along the Arabian Sea coast.
      It is the former capital of Pakistan and capital of the province of Sindh.
      Ranked as a beta-global city,[20][21] it is Pakistan's premier industrial
      and financial centre,[22] with an estimated GDP of over $200 billion (PPP)
      as of 2021.[15][16] Karachi paid $9 billion (25% of whole country) as tax
      during fiscal year July 2021 to May 2022 according to FBR report. Karachi
      is Pakistan's most cosmopolitan city, linguistically, ethnically, and
      religiously diverse,[23] as well as one of Pakistan's most socially
      liberal cities.[24][25][26] Karachi serves as a transport hub, and
      contains Pakistan's two largest seaports, the Port of Karachi and Port
      Qasim, as well as Pakistan's busiest airport, Jinnah International
      Airport.[27] Karachi is also a media center, home to news channels, film
      and fashion industry of Pakistan. Most of Pakistan's multinational
      companies and banks have their headquarters in Karachi. Karachi is also a
      tourism hub due to its scenic beaches, historic buildings and shopping
      malls. The region has been inhabited for millennia,[28] but the city was
      formally founded as the fortified village of Kolachi as recently as
      1729.[29][30] The settlement greatly increased in importance on arrival of
      the East India Company in the mid-19th century. British administrators
      embarked on substantial projects to transform the city into a major
      seaport, and connect it with the extensive railway network of the Indian
      subcontinent.[30] At the time of the partition of India in 1947, the city
      was the largest in Sindh with an estimated population of 400,000
      people.[23] Following the independence of Pakistan, the city experienced a
      dramatic shift in population and demography with the arrival of hundreds
      of thousands of Muhajir (Urdu-speaking people) Muslim refugees from
      India,[31] coupled with a substantial exodus of its Hindu residents, whose
      numbers declined from 51.1% to 1.7% of the total population.[32][33] The
      city experienced rapid economic growth following Pakistan's independence,
      attracting migrants from throughout the country and other regions in South
      Asia.[34] According to the 2017 Census of Pakistan, Karachi's total
      population was 16,051,521, with 14.9 million of those people residing in
      the urban areas of the city. Karachi is one of the world's fastest-growing
      cities,[35] and has significant communities representing almost every
      ethnic group in Pakistan. Karachi holds more than two million Bengali
      immigrants, a million Afghan refugees, and up to 400,000 Rohingyas from
      Myanmar.[36][37][38] Karachi is now Pakistan's premier industrial and
      financial centre. The city has a formal economy estimated to be worth $190
      billion as of 2021, which is the largest in the country.[39][40] Karachi
      collects 35% of Pakistan's tax revenue,[41] and generates approximately
      25% of Pakistan's entire GDP.[42][43] Approximately 30% of Pakistani
      industrial output is from Karachi,[44] while Karachi's ports handle
      approximately 95% of Pakistan's foreign trade.[45] Approximately 90% of
      the multinational corporations and 100% of banks operating in Pakistan are
      headquartered in Karachi.[45] Karachi is considered to be Pakistan's
      fashion capital,[46][47] and has hosted the annual Karachi Fashion Week
      since 2009.[48][49] Known as the "City of Lights" in the 1960s and 1970s
      for its vibrant nightlife,[50] Karachi was beset by sharp ethnic,
      sectarian, and political conflict in the 1980s with the large-scale
      arrival of weaponry during the Soviet–Afghan War.[51] The city had become
      well known for its high rates of violent crime, but recorded crimes
      sharply decreased following a crackdown operation against criminals, the
      MQM political party, and Islamist militants, initiated in 2013 by the
      Pakistan Rangers.[52] As a result of the operation, Karachi dropped from
      being ranked the world's 6th-most dangerous city for crime in 2014, to
      128th by 2022.[53]
